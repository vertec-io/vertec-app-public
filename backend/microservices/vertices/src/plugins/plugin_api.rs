// This file should define the PluginApi trait that all plugins must implement.
// The trait should include methods for handling operations on the vertices, 
//such as create_vertex, get_vertex, update_vertex, and delete_vertex.
//NOTE --> It may be necessary to move the current functionality in ../vertices/handlers.rs to here

//This will most likely utilize the ../vertices/vertex_api.rs extensively
